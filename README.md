# A/B Testing
## Overview
Two case studies for A/B Testing are completed; one for a hypothetical softward company trying to improve download and purchasing rates of their software, and another, a former "take-home" assignment for Starbucks job candidates, investigating seven abstract features to indicate whether a customer should receive a promotion.

These exercises are included as part of the course materials for Udacity's [Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) certification.

## Technologies Used
- Python
  - Jupyter notebooks
  - Libraries: pandas, numpy, statsmodels

## Key Findings
### [Homepage Experiment](https://github.com/rebeccaebarnes/A-B-Testing/blob/master/homepage_experiment.ipynb)
- There was a significant difference in the number of downloads of the software as a result of changes to the homepage (location of information informing of the free trial period)
- There was not a significant difference in the number of purchases of the software during the testing period
- Criteria for a successful test was that either of the evaluation metrics were considered successful, so the test was considered a success, with a recommendation that the changes be implemented
- The results suggest that this change in the homepage will not be associated with an increase in revenue and further examination of factors leading to increased purchases are recommended
